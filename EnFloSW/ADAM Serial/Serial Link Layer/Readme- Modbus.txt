Note- the static copies of old Modbus libraries which were once here have now been removed.

Code which relied on them should be edited to use instead the Plasmionique Modbus library available through VIPM (VI Package Manager) or from the website here:
https://lavag.org/files/file/286-plasmionique-modbus-master/
Or here:
https://github.com/rfporter/Modbus-Master

The Plasmionique Modbus Library was chosen in preference to the NI-native version, as Plasmionique’s is fully open-source, down to the primitive VIs, while NI’s implementation has locked diagrams at the lower level...

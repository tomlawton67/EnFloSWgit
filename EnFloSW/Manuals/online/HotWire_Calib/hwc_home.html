  <h2 align="center">An Example of a Hot Wire Calibration against a Pitot-Static tube connected to a micromanometer</h2>

 
<p> The aim of this calibration is to relate the voltage output from the hot wire anemometer to a fluid velocity. The reference velocity could be obtained using any instrument that can measures the flow velocity, but in this example a pitot-static tube is used. The pressure difference between the two tubes connected to the pitot-static tube, known as the dynamic pressure (P<sub>dyn</sub>), can be measured using a micromanometer which gives an output voltage proportional to the measured pressure. The micromanometer and hot wire anemometer voltages can be collected via the data acquisition channels and the average values computed for each calibration point. Using the <a href="../Mano_Calib/mc_home.html">micromanometer's calibration</a>, P<sub>dyn</sub> can be calculated from its voltage output. To compute the fluid velocity from P<sub>dyn</sub> the density of the air must be accurately known. The air density is automatically calculated by the calibration program, using the equation &rho;<sub>air</sub> =P/(R*T) where P is the absolute pressure in (N/m<sup>2</sup>), R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg K), and T is the air temperature in Kelvin. The corresponding velocity associated with the dynamic pressure is then calculated using the equation Velocity = (2*P<sub>dyn</sub>/&rho;<sub>air</sub>)<sup>0.5</sup></p>

<p>The <strong>Calibration.vi</strong> then performs a King's Law fit to the calibration points having the form E<sup>2</sup> = A + BU<sup>n</sup> where E is the anemometer voltage, U is the fluid velocity and A, B and n are fitting coefficients. The program does give the user the option to specify the value of n if desired.

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>The hot wire bridge must first be balanced for the desired probe and the bridge tested and adjusted to give optimal frequency response. The hot wire probe needs to be placed in a low turbulence flow along side the pitot static tube. In this example the hot wire signal is connected to Channel 2 of the ADC488 connection box and the signal from the micromanometer is connected to Channel 0.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>This is the <strong>Calibration.vi</strong> which should now be showing. It should have initialised itself to show the most recent calibration that has been carried out, or be blank if this is the first calibration carried out using <strong>Calibration.vi</strong> on this machine</p></p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>If the <strong>Calib file</strong> box on the <strong>Calibration.vi</strong> was left blank the file dialog will appear asking the user to choose a new or existing calibration file. The Calibration file created in this example is <strong>/Users/paul_local/Documents/LabVIEW_data/Examples/Calib_Files/HotWire_Calib.txt</strong></p>

    <p>Enter the voltage limits for both the hot wire anemometer and micromanometer voltage outputs. This will enable the acquisition system to optimise the use of its A to D converter voltage range. The Temperature and Pressure inputs at the bottom of this panel are used to determine the air density (&rho;<sub>air</sub>) required in to calculate the fluid velocity from the pitot-static tube dynamic pressure (P<sub>dyn</sub>).</p>
<p> Velocity = (2*P<sub>dyn</sub>/&rho;<sub>air</sub>)<sup>0.5</sup></p>
 <p>The <strong>Acquisition Method</strong> used in this example is the ADC488 which is an external Analogue to Digital convertor having it own onboard memory and is linked to the computer via a GPIB interface.</p>

    <p>This would be considered a good hot wire calibration over the velocity range from 3m/s to 11m/s since the <strong>Av % err</strong> is 0.06% which is very low. For a reasonable calibration you would expect this value to be less than 1%.</p>

<p>The coefficients A, B and n stored in the calibration file can now be used by <strong>Measurement.vi</strong> to convert the hot wire voltage output to a reading of velocity using the equation</p>
 <p>Velocity = [(E<sup>2</sup> - A) / B]<sup>1/n</sup></p> 
 <p>where E is the hot wire anemometer voltage output.</p>

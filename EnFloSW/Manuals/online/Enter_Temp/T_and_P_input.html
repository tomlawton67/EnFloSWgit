     <p>The current values of temperature and pressure can be entered here.</p>

     <p>In the EnFlo Lab where there is a server choose the <strong>Server Link Healthy</strong> option as shown below</p>
     <img src="Figures/Enter_Temp1.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="288">
    <p>If you have a server computer in your lab that is used to log all the background conditions, you probably want the <strong>Server Link Healthy</strong> option which enables you to use for example the channel named <strong>A Tunnel:Trav:1</strong> for the Flow temperature value and the channel named <strong>Froude:NPL:Atmos_Press</strong> for the Absolute pressure of the air in the Flow Rig. You can change the server channel you wish to use by clicking on the appropriate <strong>Browse</strong> button.</p>

<p>The <strong>CURRENT VALUES</strong> will be greyed out if they are not able to be changed from this panel. Some Server channels are denoted <strong>Hold Value</strong> which means that you would be able to edit their value from this panel</p>

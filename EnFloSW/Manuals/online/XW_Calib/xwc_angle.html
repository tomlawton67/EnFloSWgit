  <h2 align="center">An Example of a Cross Hot Wire Angle Calibration</h2>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
 


   <tr><td align="center" width="100%">
   
    <p>In making cross wire measurements, one must take account for the fact that not all of the cooling of the hot wire is caused by the flow normal to the wire. The effective angle method is the approach used by the EnFlo Software to account for the cooling effect of flow along the length of the wire. The effective wire angles are found during the calibration procedure, which can be divided into two parts: a velocity calibration and an angle calibration. The velocity calibration procedure must be performed first and is identical to that of the single hot wire. Once the velocity calibration constants are known, one then performs the angle calibration to find the effective angles, which are assumed to be constant over a range of velocities. The angle calibration is generally performed only once for a specific probe; however, the velocity calibration must be performed each time the probe is used.</p>

<p>The angle calibration is performed by rotating the probe through a series of angles (theta) from -15 to +15 degrees from its normal measurement position for a standard XW probe having an included angle of 90 deg between the wires. However, in this example a XW probe having an included angle of 120deg was used and was calibrated over a range of -25 to +25 degrees. The 120 degree probe works better in higher turbulence flows than the standard probe since rectification errors will not occur so readily.</p>

<p>The effective angles for each wire are determined by fitting a straight line through the data using the equation:</p>

<p> where E overbar is the mean anemometer voltage, A, B and n are the coefficients determined from the velocity calibration, U is velocity at which the angle calibration was carried out, &theta; is the angle of the probe to the flow and &psi; is the effective wire angle that you are determining from the angle calibraition.</p>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>The hot wire bridges must first be balanced for the desired probe and the bridge tested and adjusted to give optimal frequency response. A <a href="xwc_1st_vel.html">cross wire velocity calibration</a> then needs to be preformed before carrying out an angle calibration</p>

The hot wire probe needs to be placed in a low turbulence steady flow and be held in such a way as will allow the angle of the probe to be changed with respect to the oncoming flow.</p>

<p> In this example the hot wire signal is connected to Channel 2 and 3 of the ADC488 connection box and the signal from the micromanometer is connected to Channel 0.</p>

    <p>Firstly change the <strong>Instrument type</strong> to <strong>Cross wire angle</strong></p>

  <h2 align="center">An Example of a Cross Hot Wire First Velocity Calibration against a Pitot-Static tube connected to a micromanometer</h2>

  <p>In making cross wire measurements, one must take account for the fact that not all of the cooling of the hot wire is caused by the flow normal to the wire. The effective angle method is the approach used by the EnFlo Software to account for the cooling effect of flow along the length of the wire. The effective wire angles are found during the calibration procedure, which can be divided into two parts: a velocity calibration and an angle calibration. The velocity calibration procedure must be performed first and is identical to that of the single hot wire. Once the velocity calibration constants are known, one then performs the angle calibration to find the effective angles, which are assumed to be constant over a range of velocities. The angle calibration is generally performed only once for a specific probe; however, the velocity calibration must be performed each time the probe is used.</p>


<p> The aim of the velocity calibration is to relate the voltage output from the hot wire anemometer to a fluid velocity. The reference velocity could be obtained using any instrument that can measures the flow velocity, but in this example a pitot-static tube is used. The pressure difference between the two tubes connected to the pitot-static tube, known as the dynamic pressure (P<sub>dyn</sub>), can be measured using a micromanometer which gives an output voltage proportional to the measured pressure. The micromanometer and hot wire anemometer voltages can be collected via the data acquisition channels and the average values computed for each calibration point. Using the <a href="../Mano_Calib/mc_home.html">micromanometer's calibration</a>, P<sub>dyn</sub> can be calculated from its voltage output. To compute the fluid velocity from P<sub>dyn</sub> the density of the air must be accurately known. The air density is automatically calculated by the calibration program, using the equation &rho;<sub>air</sub> =P/(R*T) where P is the absolute pressure in (N/m<sup>2</sup>), R is the specific gas constant for air (287 J/kg K), and T is the air temperature in Kelvin. The corresponding velocity associated with the dynamic pressure is then calculated using the equation Velocity = (2*P<sub>dyn</sub>/&rho;<sub>air</sub>)<sup>0.5</sup></p>

<p>The <strong>Calibration.vi</strong> then performs a King's Law fit to the calibration points having the form E<sup>2</sup> = A + BU<sup>n</sup> where E is the anemometer voltage, U is the fluid velocity and A, B and n are fitting coefficients. The program does give the user the option to specify the value of n if desired.

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>The hot wire bridges must first be balanced for the desired probe and the bridge tested and adjusted to give optimal frequency response. The hot wire probe needs to be placed in a low turbulence flow along side the pitot static tube. In this example the cross wire signal is connected to Channels 2 and 3 of the ADC488 connection box and the signal from the micromanometer is connected to Channel 0.</p>

    <p>This would be considered a good cross wire velocity calibration over the velocity range from 3m/s to 11m/s since the <strong>Av % err</strong> are below 0.15% which is quite low. For a reasonable calibration you would expect this value to be less than 1%.</p>


<p>The First Velocity Calibration has now been completed but before this cross wire calibration file can be used by <strong>Measurement.vi</strong> an <a href="xwc_angle.html">Angle Calibration</a> must be performed</p>

  <h2 align="center">The Cross Hot Wire Calibration procedure using the EnFlo software</h2>

   
    <p>In making cross wire measurements, one must take account for the fact that not all of the cooling of the hot wire is caused by the flow normal to the wire. The effective angle method is the approach used by the EnFlo Software to account for the cooling effect of flow along the length of the wire. The effective wire angles are found during the calibration procedure, which can be divided into two parts: a <a href="xwc_1st_vel.html">Velocity calibration</a> and an <a href="xwc_angle.html">Angle calibration</a>. The velocity calibration procedure must be performed first and is identical to that of the <a href="../HotWire_Calib/hwc_home.html">Single hot wire</a>. Once the velocity calibration constants are known, one then performs the angle calibration to find the effective angles, which are assumed to be constant over a range of velocities. The angle calibration is generally performed only once for a specific probe; however, the velocity calibration must be performed each time the probe is used.</p>

<p>After completing the initial velocity calibration and the angle calibration it is recommended that a <a href="xwc_2st_vel.html">second velocity calibration</a> is performed before making measurements.</p>

These are examples for the files you can use to proide targets for CPP-BLplotter.

They are read using the RFP template file included here; as such columns can be in any order, and there can be additional columns which will be ignored.

They now follow a true TidyData format, with every line explicit. However, on reading, only (probably..) the final value of n supplied will get used.
